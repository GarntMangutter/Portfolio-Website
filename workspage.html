    <h2>About Works</h2>

    <p id="basicpara1"><br>When I entered high school and began in the computer science elective pathway, I began to start learning the basics of computer programming and code in sophomore year. I absolutely loved it. The idea of typing in several functions and commands into a computer and quite practically utilizing it to complete an application was and still is amazing to me. Sophomore year I began learning the coding language Python and its basics and all of my applications to date have been with the comprehensive language (except this HTML page in which I developed myself ;) ) Here on this section of my portfolio are the most notable (and complete) programs I have made with Python.</p>

    <h3 id="codetitle">The Battle of Luck</h3>
    
    <p id="codedescription">This Python program I created simulates a luck based battle game where there is you vs an enemy. The game randomizes several layers of the game, you are giving an attack move and a defend move, and the stats for how much health the enemy gets and how much damage it does, as well as yours, are randomized. When either you or the enemy run out of health, then the game displays how much health the other had left, and a "Game Over" or "Congratulations", effectively ending the program. The program when ran again will start over.</p>

    <h3 id="codetitle">The Pomodoro Timer</h3>

    <p id="codedescription">After learning about the famous Pomodoro Method of working, I created this timer in sophomore year. This application is meant for pushing through large workloads and learning time management. It functions to time someone for 20 minutes so that that person can stay focused and on work mode. And then when the time is up, it gives an alert for the break time starting, in which someone can relax and do whatever until they are back on work mode. I shortened the times in the actual code so that it could be graded by my teacher without taking up loads of their time.</p>

    <h3 id="codetitle">The Master Decrypter</h3>

    <p id="codedescription">The Master Decrypter is a simple tool program that can decrpyt any Caesar Cypher based encryption. The Caesar Cypher encryption is a way of taking every letter or character in a message and changing each one by an unknown numerical value/key, counting up the alphabet. So if my message was "ab" and the key was 1, then my encrypted message would be "bc", a simple concept. This decrpytor takes the user-inputted encrypted message and prints every single possible message it could be, so that all the user has to do is scroll until they find the intelligable message.</p>
