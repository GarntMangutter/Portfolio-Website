    <h2>About Music</h2>
    <p id="basicpara1">Growing up in a largely musical family when I was young has always been the main push for my love for music. However, when that collided with my love for technology, I never thought I could be so interested in something. In about 2017, I decided to check back on an old music production application I used to play around with as a kid with an old Windows 98 computer in their bedroom. I became so fascinated by it, and wanted to learn more and more about how to create higher quality music on it. I ran into SoundCloud's service where I could release music for free on it, and I decide that this project should have a cool alias name and brand behind it as well, so it could gain more traction online. I named this music alias "Garquo" using a random word generator and piece two halves of two of the words together. The logo was this symbol I used to draw everywhere on my drawing pads and sketchbooks in middle school. More than three years later since I have created this project, Garquo has gained several follows from friends, family, and audiences from around the world. I have gathered over 2,700 listens on all my platforms and have expanded my music from different genres, formats, platforms, and styles. It's safe to say I won't stop with project now, as there is still so much I could learn and the passion and feeling I get for making and releasing music is incomparable to any other feeling I've ever had.</p>

    <h4 id="musicheading2">About 'Thoughts'</h4>

    <p id="basicpara1">Being my earliest made album that was released and distributed across all mainstream platforms, Thoughts will always hold a special place in my heart. This album has heavily influences of ambient, melodic, lofi textures will minor tones and calming atmospheres.</p>

    <h4 id="musicheading2">About 'Analog Static LP'</h4>

    <p id="basicpara1">My largest project to date, Analog Static LP is a 20 track lofi, hiphop and downtempo album taking on several different mixes from bright reverbed ambiences, to deep, dusty, and warm tones. This album is composed of my best tracks around the lofi genre and have been standing out as amongst my best works because of the dedicated fanbse around the genre.</p>

    <h4 id="musicheading2">About 'Ascension EP'</h4>

    <p id="basicpara1">Ascension EP is my latest release currently, holding 4 tracks that range from genres of trap rhythms and having largely cinematic, energetic melodic sequences. This album touches upon other inspirations of mine such as wave music, which will definitely be a hint for what future projects I have coming up.</p>

    <h4 id="musicheading2">About My Other Singles</h4>

    <p id="basicpara1">Not forgetting my two other singles out, 'Intensity' and 'Solemn' are my two first releases that were made available on mainstream music platforms. 'Intensity' one of my most proudest tracks and a popular one amongst friends and family, takes on the heavy bass forms of trap and dubstep. 'Solemn' is my more trap and hiphop oriented track that still brings a unforgetable harmony in the tonals and basses.</p>
